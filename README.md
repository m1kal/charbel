# Charbel

Write synthesizable FPGA code with Clojure syntax.
SystemVerilog code is generated.

The goal of the project is to write Verilog modules with less code. With fewer lines of code a larger part of a module fits on the screen. Clojure syntax seems a perfect solution.

## Online version (using ClojureScript)

To use Charbel in the browser (without the need to install and learn Clojure), use

[https://m1kal.github.io/charbel/](https://m1kal.github.io/charbel/)

This site works on the client side - your code is not sent anywhere.

## Usage

Add dependency in project.clj:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.github.m1kal/charbel.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.github.m1kal/charbel)

Require the library:

    (:require [charbel.core :refer :all])

Create an intermediate representation from Clojure expression:

    (def adder-module
      (module adder
        [[:in a 16] [:in b 16] [:out c 16]]
        (register dout (+ a b))
        (assign c (select dout 16 0)))

Or use input string:

    (def adder-module
      (module-from-string
        "(module sum
                 [[:in a 4] [:in b 4] [:out c 4]]
                 (assign c (+ a b)))"))

Create SystemVerilog code:

    (build adder-module)

## Usage

### Define a module

    (module <name> [configuration] <ports> <body>)

* configuration is an optional map containing parameters and clocks
  * :clocks [[\<clock1\> \<reset1\>] [\<clock2\> \<reset2\>] ...]
  * :parameters [\<name1\> \<value1\> \<name2\> \<value2\> ...]
* ports is a vector of vectors, each containing
  * optional direction: :in or :out
  * name
  * width
* body is a list of statements
  * (register \<name\> \<expression\>)
  * (assign \<name\> \<expression\>)
  * (out \<name\> \<width\> \<expression\>)
  * (cond* \<name\> \<condition1\> \<expression1\> \<condition2\> \<expression2\> ...)
  * (case \<name\> \<selector\> \<value1\> \<expression1\> \<value2\> \<expression2\> ...)
  * (instance \<module\> \<name\> ([\<port\> \<connection\>] ...))
  * (declare \<name\> \<width\>)
  * (generate [\<genvar\> \<start\> \<stop\>] expressions)

### Supported expressions

    (+ <a> <b> ...)
    (- <a> <b> ...)
    (* <a> <b> ...)
    (if <condition> <value-if-true> <value-if-false>)
    (cond <condition1> <expression1> <condition2> <expression2> ...)
    (select <signal> <msb> [<lsb>])
    (vector <a> <b> ...)
    (inc <a>)
    (dec <a>)
    (bit-and <a> <b> ...)
    (bit-or <a> <b> ...)
    (bit-xor <a> <b> ...)
    (bit-not <a>)
    (mod <a> <b>)
    (width <width> <expression>)
    (= <a> <b> ...)
    (init <initial-value> <expression>)
    (get <memory> <address>)

`width` and `init` do not modify the expression.

### Handling memories

Memory needs to be declared:

    (array <name> <word-size> <width>)

Write to an address:

    (set-if <condition> <memory-name> <address> <data>)

Read from a memory - use the expression:

    (get <memory> <address>)

### Clocks

If clocks are not provided in configuration, the default clock is called "clk", synchronous reset is called "reset".

If more than one clock is present in a module, the registers use the first clock by default. To change it, each `register` statement using non-default clock needs to be wrapped in `clk`:

    (clk <clock-name> (register <name> <expression>))

Each clock can have an associated synchronous reset signal.

### Additional information

Output ports don't need to be declared in ports section. It is enough to use `out` statement in the body.

`let` binding should work and should result in asynchronous signal.

Width calculation does not always work correctly: when using internal signals of width larger than 32 bits, some statements might need to be wrapped in `width`.

Unsigned 64-bit numbers can be used in the code. If wider "magic numbers" are required, use literals or concatenate values using `vector`.

SystemVerilog statements can be inserted in the body as strings.

If reset signal is used, all signals are reset to 0, unless `init` is provided. If reset signal is not used, `initial` block is generated to set each register to initial value (0 or value provided by `init`).

### Building SystemVerilog code

    (build <module>)
    ;or
    (build <module> :postprocess)

The latter form adds *\`default_nettype none*, and *\`max* macro if it is needed.

## Examples

    (build
      (module lookup
              {:clocks [[clk]]}
              [[:in datain 32] [:in we 1], [:in address 32] [:out dataout 32]]
              (array mem 32 32)
              (set-if (= we 1) mem address datain)
              (register q (get mem address))
              (assign dataout q)))

results in the following SystemVerilog code:

    module lookup (
        input wire clk,
        input wire[32-1:0] datain,
        input wire we,
        input wire[32-1:0] address,
       output wire[32-1:0] dataout
    );

    logic [128-1:0] q;

    logic [32-1:0][32-1:0] mem;

    always @(posedge clk)
     if ((we == 1))
      mem[address] <= datain;

    always @(posedge clk)
     q <= (mem[address]);

    assign dataout = q;

    endmodule

Create a parametrized counter:

    (module counter
      {:parameters [WIDTH 16] :clocks [[clk_a]]}
      [[:in start 1] [:in stop 1] [:in limit WIDTH] [:in en 1] [:out value WIDTH]]
      (assign done (= cnt (dec limit)))
      (register started
                (init 0
                  (width 1
                    (if (= start 1)
                        1
                        (if stop 0 started)))))
      (register cnt
                (width WIDTH
                (if (= started 0)
                    0
                    (if (= en 1)
                        (if done 0 (inc cnt))
                        cnt))))
      (assign value cnt))

Create a state machine:

    (module fsm
      {:clocks [[clk]]}
      [[:in next 1] [:in signal 16] [:out signal_out 16]]
      (register state (init 0 (width 4 (if (= 1 signal) (mod (inc state) 3) state))))
      (cond* result (= state 0) 0 (= state 1) (+ accum input) (= state 2) input)
      (register accum (width 26 result))
      (assign signal_out (select accum 15 0)))

See `test-resources` directory for more examples.

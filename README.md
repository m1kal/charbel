# Charbel

Write synthesizable FPGA code with Clojure syntax.

## Usage

Create an intermediate representation from Clojure expression:

    (def adder-module (module adder
            [[:in a 16] [:in b 16] [:out c 16]]
            (register dout (+ a b))
            (assign c (select dout 16 0)))

Create Verilog code:

    (build adder-module)

Functions to create and assign signals:
* register name expression
* assign name expression

Supported expressions:
(+ a b), (* a b), (if a b c), (select a position),
(inc a), (dec a), (bit-and a b), (bit-xor a b),
(bit-or a b), (= a b), (width w a), (mod a b)

Clocks and resets can be declared explicitly as the first
argument to `module`. If the argument is not provided,
clock is called "clk", synchronous reset is called "reset".

## Examples

    (build
      (module lookup
              {:clocks [[clk]]}
              [[:in datain 32] [:in we 1], [:in address 32] [:out dataout 32]]
              (array mem 32 32)
              (set-if (= we 1) mem address datain)
              (register q (get mem address))
              (assign dataout q)))

results in the following SystemVerilog code:

    module lookup (
        input wire clk,
        input wire[32-1:0] datain,
        input wire[1-1:0] we,
        input wire[32-1:0] address,
       output wire[32-1:0] dataout
    );
    
    logic [128-1:0] q;
    
    logic [32-1:0][32-1:0] mem;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
     if ((we == 1))
      mem[address] <= datain;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
     q <= (mem[address]);
    
    assign dataout = q;

    endmodule

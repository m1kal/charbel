# Charbel

Write synthesizable FPGA code with Clojure syntax.
SystemVerilog code is generated.

## Usage

Create an intermediate representation from Clojure expression:

    (def adder-module (module adder
            [[:in a 16] [:in b 16] [:out c 16]]
            (register dout (+ a b))
            (assign c (select dout 16 0)))

Create Verilog code:

    (build adder-module)

Functions to create and assign signals:
* register name expression
* assign name expression

Supported expressions:
(+ a b), (* a b), (if a b c), (select a position),
(inc a), (dec a), (bit-and a b), (bit-xor a b),
(bit-or a b), (= a b), (width w a), (mod a b)

Clocks and resets can be declared explicitly as the first
argument to `module`. If the argument is not provided,
clock is called "clk", synchronous reset is called "reset".

## Examples

    (build
      (module lookup
              {:clocks [[clk]]}
              [[:in datain 32] [:in we 1], [:in address 32] [:out dataout 32]]
              (array mem 32 32)
              (set-if (= we 1) mem address datain)
              (register q (get mem address))
              (assign dataout q)))

results in the following SystemVerilog code:

    module lookup (
        input wire clk,
        input wire[32-1:0] datain,
        input wire we,
        input wire[32-1:0] address,
       output wire[32-1:0] dataout
    );
    
    logic [128-1:0] q;
    
    logic [32-1:0][32-1:0] mem;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
     if ((we == 1))
      mem[address] <= datain;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
     q <= (mem[address]);
    
    assign dataout = q;

    endmodule

Create a parametrized counter:

    (module counter
      {:parameters [WIDTH 16] :clocks [[clk_a]]}
      [[:in start 1] [:in stop 1] [:in limit WIDTH] [:in en 1] [:out value WIDTH]]
      (assign done (= cnt (dec limit)))
      (register started
                (init 0
                  (width 1
                    (if (= start 1)
                        1
                        (if stop 0 started)))))
      (register cnt
                (width WIDTH
                (if (= started 0)
                    0
                    (if (= en 1)
                        (if done 0 (inc cnt))
                        cnt))))
      (assign value cnt))

Create a state machine:

    (module fsm
      {:clocks [[clk]]}
      [[:in next 1] [:in signal 16] [:out signal_out 16]]
      (register state (init 0 (width 4 (if (= 1 signal) (mod (inc state) 3) state))))
      (cond* result (= state 0) 0 (= state 1) (+ accum input) (= state 2) input)
      (register accum (width 26 result))
      (assign signal_out (select accum 15 0)))
